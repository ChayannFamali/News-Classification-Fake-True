# News Classification Fake True
This analytical task is primarily aimed at classifying news (fake or real). It can be seen that this dataset is balanced relative to classes. Using the wordcloud function, we can see that in general fake news and real news are characterized by certain words. I also built two graphs that demonstrate the dynamics of the publication of fake and real news. After that, the data preprocessing stage was carried out (removal of punctuation marks, URL links, Zipf's law was demonstrated in reality, stop words were removed, lemmatization was carried out. At the last stage, 3 models were built. The first model is a baseline model based on logistic regression. After that, weights were extracted from the trained model and features (words). You can see which words characterize fake news, and which are real. Further, on the advice of Francois Chalet, 2 neural network technologies were built, which coped no worse than the baseline model, but were more demanding of resources, since they were trained on the GPU.
Conclusion: the baseline model coped better in this task.
